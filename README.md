# Description

I designed a JavaScript Quiz to test all users knowledge on an illuminating programming language! There are a series of 4 questions in total. 

Fun fact: I was inspired by the movie "Legally Blonde" starring Reese Witherspoon to create the color theme. This is primarily because I wanted to get all the users initial reaction "It's pink" cause I think it gives it alittle something extra. Haha!

# Installation

I used Vs Code to create my quiz and then deployed it on Github.

Usuage

1. User will be presented by the first question (out of 4) and must  carefully select the correct answer.
2. The correct answer will light up pink.
3. The incorrect answer will light up red.
4. Once user selected their question, they may click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question.
5. The score will be tallied at the end of the quiz and will show the amount of questions the user got correct out of 4.
6. User will have the option to take the quiz again by selecting "Play Again!".

# What I Learned

1. How to use Flex Box
2. How to implement arrow functions which saves so much time rather than writing single functions for each appropriate   question.
3. That I can create an array of questions inside one function alone.
